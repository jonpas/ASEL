# Airsoft Explosive Language [ASEL]

Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for easy creation of programs designed to simulate a sports explosive device in an [Airsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airsoft) setting.

ASEL is a language that translates to Arduino Language notation compatible with many development boards on the market. Syntax is simplified and oriented towards specific use, most notably very short remote control designs and powerful interfacing with external devices (speakers, LEDs, sensors).

`raw` functionality is also available, allowing raw Arduino Language code to be written within ASEL. Designed for development purposes and more advanced use than ASEL itself supports.

ASEL is created using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) [Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) for syntax and [Xtend](https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/) for semantics. Additionally leveraging Eclipse's tools, comes with IDE support.
